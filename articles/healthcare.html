    As we progress into the future, Computer Science is playing a bigger and bigger part in the field of healthcare.
    From medical informatics to AI based diagnostics, computer science is shaping the landscape of the medical world.

    Today with the aid of powerful computer and information networks, hospitals can easily organize and manage data
    records of patients, biomedical research and education. Gone are the days of sifting through paperwork to find a
    single slip of paper, now doctors can, with the click of a mouse, retrieve years worth of data on a patient allowing for
    more effective medical practices.

    Artificial intelligence is also revolutionizing the way we diagnose illnesses. Whilst a doctor will have to rely on
    their limited human knowledge to come to an accurate diagnostic, A.I can instantly check a patient's symptoms
    against thousands of data collected from other patients with similar symptoms inorder to determine what illness a
    patient may have. In particular this new method of diagnoses is helping improve the early detection rate of
    diseases like brain tumors, in which their symptoms are extremely subtle and can easily go unnoticed.

    Artificial intelligence is also helping accelerate the development of new drugs. For example AI can analyze
    molecules and predict their function or help with synthesizing new formulations of drugs. This speeds up development
    timelines,reducing the cost and risks of drug development. As an example, recent Covid-19 pandemic AI as been
    integral in the race to create a vaccine.
